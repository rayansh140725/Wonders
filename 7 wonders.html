    <details><p>
        Chichén Itzá retained its reputation as a sacred site during the time of the conquest, and Mayan pilgrims still came to the ancient capital of the Itzá to perform rituals in the Sacred Cenote , the Castle, and the Ossuary. Due to Chichén Itzá's importance, Francisco de Montejo even proposed establishing the capital of the province of Yucatán there, although the idea did not prosper. Contemporary chroniclers, such as Friar Diego de Landa , were impressed by Chichén Itzá's size and its well-preserved buildings.

<details><p>
    Petra was only rediscovered by Swiss explorer Johann Burckhardt in 1812, and it continues to spill its secrets. Even now, archaeologists have explored less than half of the sprawling site, and in 2016, with the help of satellite imagery, a monumental structure was found still buried in the sand. It's no wonder that Petra remains Jordan's top tourist attraction and one of the most revered of the World Heritage sites.
